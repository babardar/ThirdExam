	/*	Question 11: Write a Difference between String, StringBuilder and StringBuffer?
				 *  Ans:The String class is an immutable class whereas StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes 
				 *  are mutable. StringBuilder is non synchronized(not thread safe), but the Stringbuffer is synchronized(Thread safe).
				 *  
				 *  Question 12: What is the difference between List and set?
				 *  Ans:List is a type of ordered collection that maintains the elements in insertion order,
				 *       while Set is a type of unordered collection so elements are not maintained any order.
				 *       
				 *  Question 13: What is the difference between Array & ArrayList?
				 *  Ans:Array is a fixed length data structure whereas ArrayList is a variable length Collection class. 
				 *      We cannot change length of array once created in Java but ArrayList can be changed.
				 *      
				 *  Question 14: What is the difference between HAshset and Treeset?
				 *  Ans:A Set is a generic set of values with no duplicate elements. A TreeSet is a set where the elements are sorted.
				 *  
				 *  Question 16: What is the difference between Comparable and Comparator? Also list advantages and disadvantages of both.
				 *  Ans: Comparable and Comparator both are interfaces and can be used to sort collection elements.
				 *  Comparable: we can sort the collection on the basis of a single element such as id, name, or price. 
				 *  Comparator: we can sort the collection on the basis of multiple elements such as id, name, and price etc.
